**AngelHacks is a 12-hour hackathon.**
100+ students from across LA will come for the weekend.
You‚Äôll team up (or go solo, if that‚Äôs what you prefer) to build an app, game, or website.
We‚Äôll provide free meals & drinks. In the evening, judges will pick
the best projects to demo for everyone and win prizes. There'll be raffles and giveaways throughout the event as well!

## A place for everyone.

Underrepresented students are systematically discouraged from pursuing tech. Schools in LA have little to no computer science education programs‚Äîand students aren't exposed to programming until late high school or college. We're hoping to encourage students of all backgrounds, ages, and location to learn and love programming. No matter who you are, you‚Äôre welcome here‚Äîand you‚Äôll surprise yourself by what you can accomplish. üíõ

<FAQ>

- **Hacking‚ÄΩ Is that safe? üë®üèø‚Äçüíª**
  No, we‚Äôre not ‚Äúhacking‚Äù servers. The word is being constructively redefined for coding‚Äîapps, games, websites. It‚Äôs safe, supervised, & entirely educational. Now go look somewhere else, RSA.

- **What can I make? ü§ñ**
  Anything! A website, app, game, hardware hack, you name it. Judges will rate projects on creativity, technical skill demonstrated, polish, utility, and, last but not least, impact on the community.

- **What if I‚Äôm new to coding? üëæ**
  At AngelHacks, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! Learn as you go with our intro workshops & mentors.

- **Do I need a team? üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß**
  Nope! You‚Äôll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 4‚Äîfind some new friends, bring yours, or work alone.

- **What should I bring? üß≥**
  Plan to bring a student ID, computer (any kind), chargers, anything for your hack (e.g. hardware), and enthusiasm! We'll provide snacks and meals, so you don't have to worry about that!

- **Who runs this? Is it supervised? üë®‚Äçüè´**
  We‚Äôre independently-organized by high schoolers, mostly from Ad Astra Hack Club, sponsored via a nonprofit called [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). It‚Äôs fully supervised with 20+ adult mentors & chaperones.
