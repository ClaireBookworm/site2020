# We’re driven by a mission.

Technology is by far the fastest growing industry in the U.S. with hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and employers desperate for talent—but nearly all of the opportunities are on the coasts. 

AngelHacks is dedicated in encourage students to learn computer science -- at just the age where they're interested in technology and programming.

100+ students of all skill levels will assemble for a weekend of collaboration and innovation, each building apps/websites/games that give back to the community in 12 hours. Then participants and judges will select the winning projects and teams.



# Coding is a superpower.
Starting to code has a lasting impact. Once you begin coding, you switch from being a consumer to being a creator. We want to make everyone a creator—it’s a magical transformation. You can solve problems your way, bounded only by your imagination.

We know this because we’re the leaders of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub/) at Ad Astra School, where we have good infrastructure for students to learn to code. Now, we want to bring that experience to everyone. This is a hackathon by the students, for the students, and for the future of all of Los Angeles.
